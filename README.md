# discord-stats

Quick Python script to count word occurrences in Discord chats. 



## Usage

#### Prerequisites

- A Python 3 environment
- Your [Discord data package](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data)

#### Running

Run `main.py`, write the path to your Discord messages data (`package.zip/messages`), enter the word you want to search for.



## Notice

Keep in mind that you are running a script on all your private Discord data. Get in the habit of checking the code before downloading and running it, or ask someone who can do it for you. Discord themselves barely cares about scams, so be careful not to blindly leak your token or messages.
